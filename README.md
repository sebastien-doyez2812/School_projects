This repository contains my projects carried out in enginnerring school.

_ The "Automation_&_networks" project concerns a simulation of sending instructions, delayed by a client-server system, to a robotic arm on Coppeliasim.<br><br>
_ The "Perception" folder contains reports of work done on Matlab, as well as the tested code.<br><br>
_ "ROS2_project" is the work I did for the Cohoma challenge, in partnership with the French Army.<br><br>
_ The two folders "Robotics_project" are the reports and the code of mobile robotics and manipulation projects made in Julia and Matlab.<br><br>
_ "Software part of a corporate pointer"  contains HTML code and SQL commands, which is the software part (website + database)  of a corporate pointer.<br><br>
